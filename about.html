                                    Nicknamed `Mac`. Based in Geelong, Victoria, Australia.</p>
                                <p class="paragraph-context">
                                    I have completed a degree in <span>Computing & Software Engineering</span> with extensive knowledge in applications development. The core languages I used were <span>Visual Basic, VB.Net, ASP.Net, HTML, CSS and SQL</span>.</p>
                                <p class="paragraph-context">
                                    I started my career as an <span>IT Support Specialist</span>, accruing hours of IT managed services for corporate clients in <span>Brunei Darussalam</span>. The position provided me with the chance to deal with real-world situations while also honing my skills in working with a wide range of application systems, including but not limited to Accounting, Stock Inventory, HR, ERP, and POS. I had managed and led hundreds of projects over the years that includes <span>system upgrades and migration, as well as software development</span>.</p>
                                <p class="paragraph-context">
                                    I moved to <span>Australia</span> after 8 years for the purpose of a better life, but had difficulties due to visa work rights limitations. I worked as a <span>Vehicle detailer</span> during that period until a regional skilled visa was granted, providing full work rights to which gave me the opportunity to focus on <span>rebuilding my career in IT</span>.</p> 
                                <p class="paragraph-context"> 
                                    While actively searching for work, I am currently enrolled in an online <span>Full Stack Flex</span> course hosted by Monash University, Melbourne. This will provide the opportunity for me, particularly during this epidemic, to broaden my knowledge of <span>latest web development</span> technologies while also allowing me to adapt to the country's emerging trend of working from home.
